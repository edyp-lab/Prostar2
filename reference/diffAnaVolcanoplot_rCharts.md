# Volcanoplot of the differential analysis

\#' Plots an interactive volcanoplot after the differential analysis.
Typically, the log of Fold Change is represented on the X-axis and the
log10 of the p-value is drawn on the Y-axis. When the `th_pval` and the
`th_logfc` are set, two lines are drawn respectively on the y-axis and
the X-axis to visually distinguish between differential and non
differential data. With the use of the package Highcharter, a
customizable tooltip appears when the user put the mouse's pointer over
a point of the scatter plot.

## Usage

``` r
diffAnaVolcanoplot_rCharts(
  df,
  th_pval = 1e-60,
  th_logfc = 0,
  conditions = NULL,
  clickFunction = NULL,
  pal = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- df:

  A dataframe which contains the following slots : x : a vector of the
  log(fold change) values of the differential analysis, y : a vector of
  the p-value values returned by the differential analysis. index : a
  vector of the rowanmes of the data. This dataframe must has been built
  with the option stringsAsFactors set to FALSE. There may be additional
  slots which will be used to show informations in the tooltip. The name
  of these slots must begin with the prefix "tooltip\_". It will be
  automatically removed in the plot.

- th_pval:

  A floating number which represents the p-value that separates
  differential and non-differential data.

- th_logfc:

  A floating number which represents the log of the Fold Change that
  separates differential and non-differential data.

- conditions:

  A list of the names of condition 1 and 2 used for the differential
  analysis.

- clickFunction:

  A string that contains a JavaScript function used to show info from
  slots in df. The variable this.index refers to the slot named index
  and allows to retrieve the right row to show in the tooltip.

- pal:

  xxx
