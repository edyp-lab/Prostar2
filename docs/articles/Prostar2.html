      <p>This vignette describes Prostar (Proteomics statistical
      analysis with R) which is a Bioconductor distributed R package
      which provides all the necessary functions to analyze quantitative
      data from label-free proteomics experiments. Contrarily to most
      other similar R packages, it is endowed with rich and
      user-friendly graphical interfaces, so that no programming skill
      is required. This document covers the functionalities available in

<p><em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPAR" class="external-link">DAPAR</a></em> and
<em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
package are a series of software dedicated to the processing of
proteomics data. More precisely, they are devoted to the analysis of
quantitative datasets produced by bottom-up discovery proteomics
experiments with a LC-MS/MS pipeline (Liquid Chromatography and Tandem
Mass spectrometry). <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPAR" class="external-link">DAPAR</a></em>
(Differential Analysis of Protein Abundance with R) is an R package that
contains all the necessary functions to process the data in command
lines. It can be used on its own; or as a complement to the numerous
Bioconductor packages () it is compliant with; or through the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
interface. <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
(Proteomics statistical analysis with R) is a web interface based on
Shiny technology () that provides GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) to all
the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPAR" class="external-link">DAPAR</a></em>
functionalities, so as to guide any practitioner that is not comfortable
with R programming through the complete quantitative analysis process.
The experiment package <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPARdata" class="external-link">DAPARdata</a></em>
contains many datasets that can be used as examples. <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
functionalities make it possible to easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Manage quantitative datasets</strong> Here, a quantitative
dataset denotes a table where each analyte (either a peptide or a
protein) is represented by a line and each replicate (or sample) is
represented by a column; each cell of the table contains the abundance
of a given analyte in a given replicate; the replicates are clustered
into different conditions (or groups). This includes import/export,
conversion and report generation functionalities.</li>
<li>
<strong>Perform a complete data processing chain</strong>:
(<em>i</em>) filtering and data cleaning; (<em>ii</em>) cross-replicate
normalization; (<em>iii</em>) missing value imputation; (<em>iv</em>)
aggregation of peptide intensities into protein intensities (optional);
(<em>v</em>) null hypothesis significance testing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mine the dataset</strong> at any step of the processing
chain with various tools such as: (<em>i</em>) descriptive statistics;
(<em>ii</em>) differential analysis; (<em>iii</em>) Gene Ontology (GO)
analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installation"></a>
</h2>
<p>There are many ways to install <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>,
as well as its dependencies (i.e. Packages that are necessary for <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
to correctly run:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Zero-install</strong>: The easiest way, so far only
available on Microsoft Windows desktop machines.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stand-alone Bioconductor install</strong>: The standard
method to install Bioconductor distributed software. This method works
for any operating systems (Unix/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows) as long as
R is installed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Server install</strong>: When one wants <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
to run on a Unix server, on which remote users connect.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, it is also possible to only install <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPAR" class="external-link">DAPAR</a></em> or
<em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPARdata" class="external-link">DAPARdata</a></em>,
so as to work in command lines (for expert users only).</p>
<p>For all the desktop installs, we advise to use a machine with a
minimum of 8GB of RAM (although there are no strict constraints).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="zero-install">Zero-install<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#zero-install"></a>
</h3>
<p>This method works for any desktop machine with Microsoft Windows. It
is not necessary to have R already installed. Go to and click on
Zero-install download (Prostar menu). Download the zip file and unzip
it. The unzipped folder contains an executable file which directly
launches <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>.
Notice that at the first launch, an internet connection is necessary, so
as to finish the install.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="stand-alone-bioconductor-install">Stand-alone Bioconductor install<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#stand-alone-bioconductor-install"></a>
</h3>
<p>For this type of install, the operating system of the desktop machine
can be of any type (Unix/Linux, Mac OS X or Windows). However, it is
necessary to have the latest version of R (see Section~) installed in a
directory where the user has read/write permissions. Optionally, an IDE
(integrated development environment) such as R Studio () may be useful
to conveniently deal with the various R package installs.</p>
<p>To install <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>,
enter in the R console the following instructions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html" class="external-link">install.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"BiocManager"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>

<p>Once the package is installed, to launch <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>,
then enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">Prostar</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">Prostar</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>A new window of the default web browser opens.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="server-install">Server install<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#server-install"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the case of several <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
users that are not confortable with R (programming or installing), it is
best to have a single version of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
running on a Shiny server installed on a Unix/Linux server. The users
will use <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
through a web browser, exactly if it were locally installed, yet, a
single install has to be administrated. In that case, <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPAR" class="external-link">DAPAR</a></em> has
to be classically installed (see Section~), while on the other hand, the
installation of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
is slightly different.</p>
<p>Shiny Server () is a server program that makes Shiny applications
available over the web. If Shiny Server is not installed yet, follow
Shiny installation instructions.</p>
<p>Once a Shiny server is available, first install <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
as described in Section~, so as to have the dependencies installed.</p>
<p>Then, execute the following line to get the install directory of
Prostar:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/installed.packages.html" class="external-link">installed.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">[</span><span class="st">"Prostar"</span>, <span class="st">"LibPath"</span><span class="op">]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result of this command is now referred as
<em>path_to_Prostar</em>.</p>
<p>Change the owner of the Shiny Server directory and log as shiny</p>
<pre class="code"><code>sudo chown shiny /srv/shiny-server
sudo su shiny</code></pre>
<p>Create a directory named <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
in the Shiny Server directory with the user shiny as owner and then copy
the Prostar files.</p>
<p>Create the directory for the shiny application</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span><span class="va">mkdir</span> <span class="op">/</span><span class="va">srv</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="va">shiny</span><span class="op">-</span><span class="va">server</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="va">Prostar</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Copy the ProstarApp directory within the shiny-server directory</p>
<pre class="code"><code>sudo cp -r /path\_to\_Prostar/ProstarApp/ /srv/shiny-server/Prostar</code></pre>
<p>Change the owner of the Shiny Server directory</p>
<pre class="code"><code>sudo chown -R shiny /srv/shiny-server</code></pre>
<p>Give the following permissions to the www directory</p>
<pre class="code"><code>chmod 755 /srv/shiny-server/Prostar/www</code></pre>
<p>Check if the configuration file of Shiny Server is correct. For more
details, please visit .</p>
<p>Now, the application should be available via a web browser at <a href="http://*servername" class="external-link uri">http://*servername</a><em>:</em>port*/Prostar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="dapar-and-dapardata-alone">

(alone)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dapar-and-dapardata-alone"></a>
</h3>
<p>This type of install should only be performed by advanced R
users/programmers, or by the admin of a server version of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>.</p>
<p>To install the package <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPAR" class="external-link">DAPAR</a></em> from
the source file with administrator rights, start R and enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">BiocManager</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocManager/reference/install.html" class="external-link">install</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"DAPAR"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPARdata" class="external-link">DAPARdata</a></em>
is automatically installed with <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
or <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/DAPAR" class="external-link">DAPAR</a></em>.
However, it is possible to install it alone. Then, it follows the
classical way for Bioconductor packages. In a R console, enter:</p>

</h4>
<p>Conducting a rigorous differential analysis requires a well-defined
pipeline made of several tightly connected steps. In <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>,
this pipeline has been designed to be as general as possible. Thus, the
<strong>Data processing</strong> menu contains numerous steps which, for
a given dataset may not all be necessary, so that some can be
occasionally skiped. However, the pipeline has been assembled and
organized so as to propose coherent processing, so that the respective
order of the different steps should be respected. These steps are the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Filtering</strong> (see Section~): to remove some analytes
(because of too many missing values, or because they are
irrelevant)</li>
<li>
<strong>Normalization</strong> (see Section~): to correct batch
effect and sample/condition biases</li>
<li>
<strong>Imputation</strong> (see Section~): to impute the remaning
missing values</li>
<li>
<strong>Aggregation</strong> (see Section~): if the dataset is a
peptide-level one, it is possible to aggregate them, so as to form a
protein-level dataset</li>
<li>
<strong>Hypothesis testing</strong> (see Section~) of the
differential abundance</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be carefully noted that each of these steps modifies the
dataset: In other words, the <strong>Data processing</strong> menu
offers a succession of data transformations which should be performed by
the user in an educated way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="the-data-mining-menu">The “Data mining” menu<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-data-mining-menu"></a>
</h4>
<p>As opposed to the <strong>Data processing</strong> menu, the
<strong>Data mining</strong> menu offers a series of tools to analyze
and visualize the dataset without transforming it. Thus, there is far
less restriction on how and when applying them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> (see Section~) panel is
composed of several tabs which provide various “static” views on the
dataset. It is advised to look at them between each processing step, so
as to check how the dataset has been transformed.</li>
<li>Once p-values have been computed (either at peptide or protein
level) (see in the <strong>{Data processing</strong> menu), it is
possible to conduct a <strong>Differential analysis</strong> (see
Section~). This consists in a series of statistical computations which
purpose is to isolate a subset of proteins deemed differentially
abundant between the compared conditions, according to a specific false
discovery rate threshold.</li>
<li>As long as the dataset is a protein-level one, it is possible to
conduct a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment or analysis on it (see
Section~). However, if the dataset is a peptide-level one, this option
does not appear.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="successive-dataset-versions">Successive dataset versions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#successive-dataset-versions"></a>
</h3>
<p>As explained above, each functionality in the <strong>Data
processing</strong> menu transforms the current dataset. To authorize
some flexibility and to avoid unwanted data corruption, it is possible
to save in <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
the original dataset, as well as each intermediate dataset along the
processing chain. Concretely, it is possible to store one “original
dataset”, one “filtered dataset”, one “normalized dataset”, one “imputed
dataset” and so on. Moreover, at any moment, it is possible to go back
to a previous state of the dataset, either to restart a step that went
wrong, or just to compare with the <strong>Data mining</strong> tools
how the dataset was changed (rapid switching makes it easier to
visualize it).</p>
<p>To create a new item in the dataset history, one simply has to click
on the save button at the end of each processing step. Each time a new
dataset is created, it is by default the one on which the processing
goes on.</p>
<p>To navigate through the dataset history, one simply uses the
drop-down menu of the upper right corner. Notice that if the user saves
the current step (e.g. imputation), then goes back to a previous step
(e.g. normalization) and start working on this older dataset (to perform
another imputation) and then saves it, the new version of the processing
overwrites the previous version (the older imputation is lost and only
the newest one is stored in memory): in fact, only a single version of
the dataset can be saved for a given processing step. As a side effect,
if any processing further than imputation was already done
(e.g. aggregation), then, the aggregated dataset is not coherent anymore
with the imputed one (as the new imputation cannot be automatically
transmitted to update the previously tuned aggregation).</p>
<p>Finally, let us note that the name of each dataset version
(normalized, imputed, etc.) also indicates if the dataset is a
protein-level or a peptide-level one (as for instance the aggregation
step transforms a peptide-level dataset into a protein-level one).</p>

<p>The quantitative data should fit into a matrix-like representation
where each line corresponds to an analyte (The analytes can be either
proteins or peptides. However, in a given dataset, all the analytes
should be of the same nature.) and each column to a sample. Within the
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math>-th,

<p>Although strictly speaking, there is no lower or upper bound to the
number of lines, it should be recalled that the statistical tools
implemented in <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
have been chosen and tuned to fit a discovery experiment dataset with
large amount of analytes, so that the result may lack of reliability on
too small datasets. Conversely, very large datasets are not inherently a
problem, as R algorithms are well scalable, but one should keep in mind
the hardware limitations of the machine on which <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
runs to avoid overloading.</p>
<p>As for the number of samples (the columns of the dataset), it is
necessary to have at least 2 conditions (or groups of samples) as it is
not possible to perform relative comparison otherwise. Moreover, it is
necessary to have at least 2 samples per condition (With only two
replicates per conditions, the computations are tractable. It does not
mean that statistical validity is guaranteed).</p>
<p>Classically, 3 replicates per conditions are considered a minimum in
case of a controlled experiment with a small variability, mainly issuing
from technical or analytical repetitions. Analysis of complex proteomes
between conditions with a large biological variability requires more
replicates per conditions (5 to 10).}, as otherwise, it is not possible
to compute an intra-condition variance, which is a prerequisite to
numerous processing.</p>
<p>The data table should be formatted in a tabulated file where the
first line of the text file contains the column names. It is recommended
to avoid special characters such as “]”, “@”, “$”, “%”, etc. that are
automatically removed. Similarly, spaces in column names are replaced by
dots (“.”). Dot must be used as decimal separator for quantitative
values. In addition to the columns containing quantitative values, the
file may contain additional columns for metadata. Alternatively, if the
data have already been processed by <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
and saved as an MSnset file , it is possible to directly reload them

includes the number of samples, the number of proteins (or peptides) in
the dataset, the percentage of missing values and the number of lines
which only contain missing values. Once done, the menu displaying the

package also contains tabular versions (in txt format) of the datasets
available in the Demo data menu. Thus, it is also possible to test the
import/export/save/load functions of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>

sub-folder: (…/R/R-3.4.0/library/DAPARdata/extdata). Note that each
dataset is also available in the MSnset format, but these datasets
should not be considered to test conversion functions from/to tabular
formats.) (If an Excel file is chosen, a drop-down menu appears to
select the spreadsheet containing the data). Once the upload is
complete, indicate whether it is a protein level dataset (i.e., each
line of the data table should correspond to a single protein) or a
peptide-level one. Indicate if the data are already log-transformed or
not. If not they will be automatically log-transformed (<em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
cannot process non-log-transformed data. Thus, do not cheat the software
by indicating data on their original scale are log-transformed.). If the
quantification software uses ‘0’ in places of missing values, tick the
last option “Replace all 0 and NaN by NA” (as in <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>,
0 is considered a value, not a missing value).</p>

where each cell has a unique content, which can serve as an ID for the
peptides/proteins), select its name in the drop-down menu. Otherwise, it
is possible to use the first option of the drop-down menu, that is the

possible to proceed (however, the content of the specified columns are
not checked, so that it is the user’s responsibility to select the

steps of a quantitative analysis. They are designed to be used in a
specific order:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Filtering</li>
<li>Normalization</li>
<li>Imputation</li>
<li>Aggregation (only for peptide-level data)</li>
<li>Hypothesis testing</li>

<p>For each step, several algorithms or parameters are available, all of
them being thoroughly detailed in the sequel of this section.</p>
<p>During each of these steps, it is possible to test several options,
and to observe the influence of the processing in the descriptive
statistics menu (see Section~), which is dynamically updated.</p>
<p>Finally, once the ultimate tuning is chosen for a given step, it is
advised to save the processing. By doing so, another dataset appears in
the Dataset versions list (see Section~). Thus, it is possible to go
back to any previous step of the analysis if necessary, without starting
back the analysis from scratch.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="filtering">Filtering<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#filtering"></a>
</h3>
<p>In this step, the user may decide to delete several peptides or
proteins according to two criteria: First is the amount of missing
values (if it is too important to expect confident processing, see tab
1); Second is string-based filtering (some analyte can be deleted after
having been tagged, such as for instance reverse sequences in
target-decoy approaches, or known contaminants, see tab 2).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/filter1.png" alt="Interface of the filtering tool - 1." width="100%"><p class="caption">
Interface of the filtering tool - 1.
</p>
</div>
<p>To filter the missing values (first tab called ), the choice of the
lines to be deleted is made by different options (see Figure~):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>None</strong>: No filtering, the quantitative data is left
unchanged. This is the default option;</li>
<li>
<strong>{Empty lines</strong>: Only the lines with 100% of missing
values (analytes that have been identified but not quantified) are
filtered out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Whole Matrix</strong>: The lines (across all conditions) in
the quantitative dataset which contain less non-missing value than a
user-defined threshold are deleted;</li>
<li>
<strong>For every condition</strong>: The lines for which each
condition contain less non-missing value than a user-defined threshold
are deleted;</li>
<li>
<strong>At least one condition</strong>: The lines for which at
least one condition contain less non-missing value than a user-defined
threshold are deleted;</li>
</ul>
<p>To visualize the effect of the filtering options (without saving the
changes or impacting the current dataset), just click on <strong>Perform
filtering</strong>. If the filtering does not produce the expected
effect, it is possible to test another one. To do so, one simply has to
choose another method in the list and click again on <strong>Perform
filtering</strong>. The plots are automatically updated. This action
does not modify the dataset but offers a preview of the filtered data.
The user can visualize as many times he/she wants several filtering
options.</p>

</div>
<p>Afterward, proceed to the <strong>String based filtering</strong>,
where it is possible to filter out proteins according to information
stored in the metadata. To do so: Among the columns constituting the
protein metadata listed in the drop-down menu, select the one containing
the information (To work properly, the selected column must contain
information encoded as a string of characters. For each protein, the
beginning of the corresponding string is compared to a given prefix. If
the prefix matches, the protein is filtered out. Otherwise, it is
conserved in the protein list. Note that the filter only operates a
prefix search (at the beginning of the string), not a general tag match
search (anywhere in the string). Similarly, filters based on regular
expressions are not implemented.) of interest (for instance,
“Contaminant” or “Reverse”) (In datasets resulting from a MaxQuant,
metadata indicates under a binary form which proteins are reversed
sequences (resulting from a target-decoy approach) and which are
potential contaminants. Both of them are indicated by a “+” in the
corresponding column (the other proteins having an NA instead). It is
thus possible to filter both reversed and contaminants out by indicating
“+” as the prefix filter. However, if adequately encoded, filtering on
other type of information is possible.).</p>
<p>Then, specify in each case the prefix chain of characters that
identifies the proteins to filter (If one has no idea of the prefixes,
it is possible to switch to the <strong>Data Explorer</strong> in the
<strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong> menu (see Section~), so as to
visualize the corresponding metadata.). Click on **Perform to remove the
corresponding proteins. A new line appears in the table listing all the
filters that have been applied. If other string-based filters must be
applied, iterate the same process as many times as necessary.</p>

</div>
<p>Once the filtering is appropriately tuned,go to the last tab (called
<strong>Visualize filtered data and validate</strong>) (see Figure~), to
visualize the set of analytes that have been filtered. Finally, click on
<strong>Save filtered dataset</strong>. A new dataset is created; it
becomes the new current dataset and its name appears in the dropdown

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="normalization">Normalization<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#normalization"></a>
</h3>
<p>The next processing step proposed by Prostar is data normalization.
Its objective is to reduce the biases introduced at any preliminary
stage (such as for instance batch effects). <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
offers a number of different normalization routines that are described
below.</p>
<p>To visualize the influence of the normalization, three plots are
displayed (see Figure~): The first two plots are those of the
<strong>Intensity distribution</strong> tab of the <strong>Descriptive
statistics</strong> (see Section~). The last one depicts the distortion
induced by the chosen normalization method on each sample.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/normalisation.png" alt="Interface of the normalization tool." width="100%"><p class="caption">
Interface of the normalization tool.
</p>
</div>
<p>Choose the normalization method among the following ones:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>None</strong>: No normalization is applied. This can be
useful in case of tightly calibrated proteomics experiments (such as
spiked-in or benchmark samples), where normalization may be more harmful
than useful. Moreover, when testing several normalizations, clicking on
``None’’ is useful to recover the original distribution, which serves as
reference to compare the methods.</li>
<li>
<strong>Global quantile alignment</strong>: The Quantile of the
intensity distributions of all the samples are equated, as proposed by
the normalize.quantiles() of . This method proposes a normalization of
important magnitude that should be cautiously used. It practically
amounts to replace abundances by order statistics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Column sums</strong>: The total intensity values of all the
samples are equated. The rationale behind is to normalize according to
the total amount of biological material within each sample. Thus, this
normalization is interesting to compare the proportions of a given
protein in different samples that do not necessarily contain the same
amount of biological material. Contrarily to the others, this
normalization is not performed on the log2 scale, for it would not have
any interpretation (the data are thus exponentiated and
re-log2-transformed as pre-and post-processing)</li>
<li>
<strong>Quantile Centering</strong>: A given quantile of the
intensity distribution is used as reference (This normalization method
should not be confused with Global quantile alignment.). It proposes to
shift the sample distributions (either all of them at once, or within
each condition at a time) to align a specific quantile: the median
(under the assumption that up-regulations and down-regulations are
equally frequent), the 15% quantile (under the assumption that the
signal/noise ratio is roughly the same in all the samples), or any other
user’s choice.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mean Centering</strong>: sample intensity distributions are
aligned on their mean intensity values (and optionally, the variance
distributions are equated to one).</li>
<li>
<strong>VSN</strong>: (or Variance Stabilizing Normalization) from
the package. Its objective is to have the analyte variance independent
of the intensity. Note that this normalization is computed on the
original intensity values, not the log2 transformed ones. The result
from the normalization is not in the log2 scale, nor in the original
one, but in-betwee: the scale is roughly linear for low-intensity values
and roughly logarithmic for high-intensity values (so as to avoid the
logarithm singularity).</li>
<li>
<strong>LOESS normalization</strong>: The intensity values are
normalized by means of a local regression model of the difference of
intensities as function of the mean intensity value, as implemented in
the normalizeCyclicLoess() from package.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, for each normalization method, the interface is automatically
updated to display the method parameters that must be tuned. Notably,
for most of the methods, it is necessary to indicate whether the method
should apply to the entire dataset at once (the <strong>overall</strong>
tuning), or whether each condition should be normalized independently of
the others (the **within conditions tuning).</p>
<p>Other parameters are method specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Quantile centering</strong>: It is necessary to define the
quantile of the intensity distribution that is used as reference. The
most classically used is the median (quantile 0.5), but other quantiles
can aslo be useful, depending on the dataset. Notably, as the lower
limit of quantitation is roughly constant over the samples, relying on a
lower quantile such as 0.15 can be efficient to alilgn the signal/noise
ratios.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mean centering</strong>: It is necessary to indicate whether
the distribution variances are scaled to 1.</li>
<li>
<strong>LOESS</strong>: The span corresponds to the proportion of
the other analytes that are considered to perform the regression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the method is correctly parametrized, click on <strong>Perform
normalization</strong>. Observe the influence of the normalization
method on the graphs. Optionally, click on “Show plot options”, so as to
tune the graphics for a better visualization. If the result of the
normalization does not correspond to the expectations, change the
normalization method or change its tuning. Once the normalization is
effective, click on <strong>Save normalization</strong>. Check that a
new version appears in the dataset version drop-down menu, referred to
as <strong>Normalized - Protein</strong> or <strong>Normalized -

</h4>
<p>Classically, missing values are categorized according to their
underlying missingness mechanism:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)</strong>: This category
of missing values gather all those which result from the combination and
propagation of multiple minor errors or stochastic fluctuations. As a
result, each missing value cannot be directly explained by the nature of
the analyte, nor by its measured intensity. MCAR values are assumed to
distribute uniformely in the dataset as well as along the intensity
range.</li>
<li>
<strong>Missing Not At Random (MNAR)</strong>: On the contrary, MNAR
have a more precise cause. Notably, in mass spectrometry-based analysis,
chemical species whose abundance are too close to the lower limit of
detection of the instrument record a higher rate of missing values. This
is why, MNAR-devoted imputation methods used in proteomics focus on
left-censored data (that is, the distribution of which with respect to
the abundance is truncated on the left side, i.e. on the region
depicting the lower abundances).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it also makes sense to classify the missing value according
to the analyte they impact, regardless of the underlying mechanism. This
is why, in <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>,
it has been decided to separate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>POV</strong> (standing for <strong>Partially Observed
Value</strong>).</li>
<li>
<strong>MEC</strong> (standing for <strong>Missing in the Entire
Condition</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>All the missing values for a given protein in a given condition are
considered POVs <strong>if and only if there is at least one observed
value for this protein in this condition</strong>. Alternatively,
<strong>if all the intensity values are missing for this protein in this
condition</strong>, the missing values are considered MECs. As a result,
each missing values is either POV or MEC. Moreover, for a given protein
across several conditions, the missing values can split into POVs and
MECs, even though within a same condition they are all of the same
type.</p>
<p>With the default color setting, POVs are depicted in light blue and
MECs in light orange.</p>
<p>In <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>,
the following assumptions are made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>In peptide-level datasets</strong>, it is either possible
to consider all the missing values, either POVs or MECS, as of the same
type and to blindly apply one of the proposed. As a more refined
alternative, we propose to rely on , which considers that:</p></li>
<li><p>MECs should always assumed to be MNAR. Note that imputing MEC
values is a real issue as, in the condition of interest, there is no
observed value to rely the imputation on.</p></li>
<li><p>No assumption should be made on POVs: they can be a mix of MCAR
and MNAR values, and the missingness mechanism of each is diagnosed
before the imputation, thanks to an routine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In protein-level datasets</strong>:</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The number of POVs is generally not large enough to perform an
accurate diagnosis of the POV missingness mechanism, as proposed with at
peptide-level. Thus, they are all assumed to be MCAR. </em> MECs are
always assumed to be MNAR and imputed accordingly.</p>
<p>As a whole, it is advised to work at peptide-level rather than
protein-level, and to use the refined imputation mechanism of .</p>
<p><strong>Remarks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, an analyte (and not a missing value) can be referred to
as , when it has both observed values and MEC (which means it is
observed in some conditions and not observed in others). This term was
coined from French “l`a/pas-l`a”(meaning “here/not-here”).</li>
<li>Contrarily to the normalization step, where it is possible to choose
between and application of the algorithm, the imputation step cannot be
applied overall-wise, but only condition-wise. The rationale behind is
that in case of very different conditions, it does not make sense to
rely on the observed values of one condition to impute those of the
others. With this regards, <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
strongly differs from most of the other proteomics software tools, where
the imputation can borrow information from multiple independent
conditions.</li>

<p>As a consequence of the previous paragraph, in protein-level
datasets, <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
proposes to use an MCAR-devoted imputation algorithm for POVs, and an
MNAR-devoted one for MECs.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/protein-POV.png" alt="POV imputation" width="100%"><p class="caption">
POV imputation
</p>
</div>
<p>On the first tab (see Figure~), select the algorithm to impute POV
values, among the following ones, and tune its parameter
accordingly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>None</strong>: No imputation is performed for POVs.</li>
<li>
<strong>SLSA</strong> (Structured Least Square Adaptative): It is a
regression based imputation method which account for a possible
hierachical design. It does not require any parameter tuning.</li>
<li>
<strong>DetQuantile</strong>: It is advised to use DetQuantile to
impute MECs rather than POVs, however, in some case, it may be
interesting to rely on a single imputation method for all the missing
values. This is why, this method is proposed also proposed for POV
imputation. DetQuantile description and parameter tuning is described
below.</li>
<li>
<strong>KNN</strong> (K-nearest neighbors): KNN imputation proposes
to estimate each missing value by the mean of the observed values of
other proteins with a similar intensity pattern (called neighbors). One
only has to tune
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>K</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math>,
the number of neighbors to account for. The method simply wraps the one
of the package, however, contrarily to the classical implementation and
use, the function processes one condition at a time, rather than all the
conditions at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to our expertise, we advise to select the
<strong>SLSA</strong> algorithm from but the other methods can also be
of interest in specific situations.</p>
<p>The first distribution plot depicts the mean intensity of each
condition conditionally to the number of missing values it contains. It
is useful to check that more values are missing in the lower intensity
range (due to left censorship).</p>
<p>The heatmap on the right hand side clusters the proteins according to
their distribution of missing values across the conditions. Each line of
the map depicts a protein. On the contrary, the columns do not depicts
the replicates anymore, as the abundance values have been reordered so
as to cluster the missing values together. Similarly, the proteins have
been reordered, so as to cluster the proteins that have a similar amount
of missing values distributed in the same way over the conditions. Each
line is colored so as to depicts the mean abundance value within each
condition. This heatmap is also helpful to decide what is the main
origin of missing values (MCAR or MNAR).</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Perform Imputation</strong>. A short text shows up
to summarize the result of the imputation, but the graphics are not
updated. However, the next tab is enabled, on which the plots are
updated with the imputation results.</p>
<p>After POVs, it is possible to deal with MECs. As a matter of fact, it
is always dangerous to impute them, as in absence of any value to rely
on, the imputation is arbitrary and risks to spoil the dataset with
maladjusted values. As an alternative, it is possible to (1) keep the
MEC as is in the dataset, yet, it may possibly impede further
processing, (2) discard them at the filter step (see Section~) so as to
process them separately. However, this will make it impossible to
include these proteins (and their processing) in the final statistics,
such as for instance FDR.</p>
<p>For MEC imputation, several methods are available (see Figure~):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>None</strong>: If MEC are not going to be imputed, this is
what to select.</li>
<li>
<strong>DetQuantile</strong>: It proposes to impute each missing
value within a given sample by a deterministic value (usually a low
value). The rationale behind is that MEC values corresponds to proteins
that are below the quantification limit in one condition, so that they
should not be imputed according to observed values in the other
conditions. Although the use of a deterministic value slightly disturb
the intensity distribution, it makes the MEC values easy to spot, as
they all correspond to a known numerical value. Concretely, the
imputation value is chosen as a (small) <strong>quantile</strong> -the
first parameter) of each sample distribution. Depending on the dataset,
a quantile between 1% and 5% should be used, depending on the stringency
you want to apply on proteins quantified only in one condition of a
pairwise comparison. In case of a dataset with too few proteins, the
lower quantile may lead to instable values. In such a case, we advise to
use a larger quantile value (for instance 10% or greater) but to use a
smaller multiplying <strong>factor</strong> (the second parameter) so as
to keep the imputation value reasonably small with respect to the
detection limit (for instance, consider a factor of 0.2 or smaller). In
any case, when using detQuantile, the list of imputation values for each
sample appears above the graphics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fixed value</strong>: As an alternative, it is possible for
the user to tune the imputation with a specific value that will be used
in all samples of all conditions. Although appealing for its simplicity,
this method may lead to important data distortion, so it is advised to
use <strong>detQuantile</strong> algorithm whenever possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our experience, we advise to use
<strong>detQuantile</strong> algorithm.</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Perform Imputation</strong>. A short text shows up
to summarize the result of the imputation, but the graphics are not
updated. As the imputation is finished, the updated plots would not be
informative, so they are not displayed on the final tab (referred to as
<strong>Validate &amp; save</strong>). Note that when displaying or
exporting the data, the color code used with missing values is still
used for the imputed values, so that at any moment, it is possible to
trace which proteins were imputed.</p>

<p>Notice that at peptide level, many lines of the dataset may

order to avoid spoiling the dataset with their meaningless imputed

Section~).</p>
<p>Two plots are available in order to facilitate the understanding of

<p>To impute the missing peptide intensity values, it is either possible
to rely on classical methods of the state of the art, or to use . The
former ones are available by choosing <strong>Basic methods</strong> in
the <strong>Algorithm</strong> drop-down menu (see Figure~). Another
drop-down menu appears proposing one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>None</strong>: No imputation is performed. This option is
convenient to recover the original missing value distribution when
comparing several imputation methods.</li>
<li>
<strong>DetQuantile</strong>: It proposes to impute each missing
value within a given sample by a deterministic value (usually a low
value). The rationale behind is that MEC values corresponds to peptides
that are below the quantification limit in one condition, so that they
should not be imputed according to observed values in the other
conditions. Although the use of a deterministic value slightly disturb

they all correspond to a known numerical value. Concretely, the

a quantile between 1% and 5% should be used, depending on the stringency
you want to apply on proteins quantified only in one condition of a
pairwise comparison. In case of a dataset with too few analytes (which
is more likely to be the case at protein-level than at peptide-level),
the lower quantile may lead to instable values. In such a case, we
advise to use a larger quantile value (for instance 10% or greater) but
to use a smaller multiplying <strong>factor</strong> (the second
parameter) so as to keep the imputation value reasonably small with
respect to the detection limit (for instance, consider a factor of 0.2
or smaller). In any case, when using detQuantile, the list of imputation
values for each sample appears above the graphics.</li>
<li>
<strong>KNN</strong> (K-nearest neighbors): KNN imputation proposes
to estimate each missing value by the mean of the observed values of
other peptides with a similar intensity pattern (called neighbors). One
only has to tune
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>K</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math>,
the number of neighbors to account for. The method simply wraps the one
of the package, however, contrarily to the classical implementation and
use, the function processes one condition at a time, rather than all the
conditions at once.</li>
<li>
<strong>MLE</strong> (Maximum Likelihood Estimation): This method,
from the package, propose to estimate the expected abundance value of
each peptide in each condition (with the maximum likelihood estimate),
and to use this expected value as replacement of missing values. There
is no parameter to tune with MLE imputation. \end{itemize}</li>
</ul>
<p>All these methods are applied on all missing values, without
diagnosing their nature, as explained in Section~. Alternatively, it is
possible to rely on (see Figure~). It works as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For POVs, a diagnosis of the nature of each missing value is
perform. As an output each POV is endowed with a probability of being
either MNAR or MCAR.</li>
<li>Several iterations (as many as tuned on the interface, default is 10
- the more iteration, the more accurate the imputation) of the following
algorithm are performed:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Randomly assign each POV to either MCAR or MNAR, according to its
diagnosis probability.</li>
<li>If it is MCAR, SLSA algorithm is used for imputation.</li>
<li>If it is MNAR, IGCDA algorithm is used for imputation.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All the POV imputed values computed along the iterations are average
to provide the imputation final results.</li>
<li>Optionally, it is possible to impute the MECs. To do so, one relies
on a slightly modified version of IGCDA, which requires tuning 2
parameters: First is the upper bound of the MNAR imputed values,
expressed as a quantile of the distribution of observed values in each
sample (default is centile 2.5). Second is the probability distribution
defined on the range of MNAR values (either uniform or beta): Beta is
more conservative, as it provides more weight on values that are close
to the detection limit, which reduces the risk of creating artificial
differentially abundant peptides (and thus proteins).</li>

<p>This steps only hold for peptide-level dataset. Its purpose is to
build a protein-level dataset on the basis of the peptide intensities
that have been processed in <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>.</p>
<p>If this step has not been fulfilled at the initial data conversion
(see Section~), it is first necessary to specify which column metadata
of the peptide-level dataset contains the parent protein IDs (which will
be used to index the protein-level dataset that is going to be
created).</p>
<p>Once the parent protein IDs are specified, two barplots are displayed
(see Figure~). They provide the distribution of proteins according to
their number of peptides (either all of them, or only those which are
specific to a single protein). These statistics are helpful to
understand the distribution of shared peptides, as well as the
peptide/protein relationships.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/aggregation.png" alt="Aggregation screen." width="100%"><p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Aggregation requires to tune the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Include shared peptides</strong>: Here, one defines if
protein intensity should be defined only by aggregating protein-specific
peptides, or if (and thus how) shared peptides should be included. If
shared peptides are not included, one faces the risk of losing some
proteins (those which do not have a single specific peptide). Three
options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>No (only protein-specific peptides)</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Yes (shared peptides processed as protein
specific)</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Yes (proportional redistribution of shared
peptides)</strong>. This last option is the most accurate one, yet, it
is slower, for proportional redistribution is iterated as many time as
necessary to reach convergence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider</strong>: The user specifies which peptides
should be considered for aggregation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>All peptides</strong>, regardless of their intensities.</li>
<li>
<strong>Only the

for
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>N</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, one defines the aggregation <strong>Operator</strong>:
Sum or Mean. However, in case of proportional redistribution of the
shared peptide intensities, only the mean operator is
available.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the aggregation is appropriately tuned, click on <strong>Perform
aggregation</strong>.</p>
<p>On the second tab, one selects the columns of the peptide dataset
that should be kept in the metadata of the protein dataset (e.g. the
sequence of the peptides). For any given parent-protein, the
corresponding information of all of its child-peptides<br>
will be grouped and stored in the protein dataset metadata. Once done,
one clicks on <strong>Save aggregation</strong>. This creates a new
“aggregated” dataset thatis directly loaded in memory.</p>
<p>As the new dataset is a protein one, the <strong>Aggregation</strong>
menu has been disabled. Thus, the interface automatically switches to
the homepage. However, the aggregated dataset is accessible and can be
analyzed (in the <strong>Data mining</strong> menu) and processed (in
the <strong>Data processing</strong> menu).</p>
<p>The aggregation being more computationaly demanding than other
processing steps, the current version of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
does not provide the same flexibility regarding the parameter tuning.
Here, it is necessary to save the aggregation result first, then, check
the results in the <strong>Descriptive statistics</strong>, and possibly
to go back to the imputed dataset with the dataset versions dropdown
menu to test another aggregation tuning. Contrarily to other processing
steps, it is not possible to visualize on-the-fly the consequences of
the parameter tuning, and to save it afterward.</p>
<p>Naturally, the output of this step is not a peptide dataset anymore,
but a protein dataset. As a result, all the plots available in <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>

<strong>log(FC) threshold</strong>. We advise to tune the logFC
threshold conservatively by avoiding discarding to many proteins with
it. Moreover, it is important tune the logFC to a small enough value, so
as to avoid discarding too many proteins. In fact, it is important to
keep enough remaining proteins for the next coming FDR computation step
(see Section~), as <em>(i)</em> FDR estimation is more reliable with
many proteins, <em>(ii)</em> FDR, which relates to a percentage, does
not make sense on too few proteins. Finally, run the tests and save the

a protein in the volcano plot, one or several tables appears below the

<h4 id="focus-on-push-p-values">Focus on: Push p-values<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#focus-on-push-p-values"></a>
</h4>
<p>When working on more than two conditions to compare, the missing
value filtering options may be difficult to tune, as a given protein can
be well-observed in a group of conditions (with no or few missing
values) and largely missing in the remaining conditions. To avoid
missing relevant proteins with such a behavior, it is advised to be
rather loose at the filtering step (for instance by filtering only
proteins that are never seen in the majority of the samples of each
condition). %, and to rely on the push p-value option available in the
differential analysis.</p>
<p>However, with loose filters, proteins with many missing values are
kept in the dataset and are then imputed, so as to present a complete
intensity distribution for the differential analysis. Therefore, when
focusing on a specific comparison among the multiple possible ones, it
is thus possible to face proteins which have largely been imputed in the
two conditions, so that in practice, one analyses the differential
abundance of a protein that is probability missing in the two
conditions. From an analytical viewpoint, such protein must not appears
as differentially abundant, even if its p-value is exceptional, for it
is too largely based on imputed values that are not trustworthy.</p>
<p>This is why, the push p-value option is proposed: it makes it
possible to force the p-values of these proteins to 1, and prevent them
to become false discoveries. Concretely, one simply has to tune
parameters of the menu, which are similar to those of the missing value
filtering (Section~). However, instead of producing discarding some
proteins, it keeps them with a p-value forced to 1 (i.e. a log(p-value)
to 0).</p>
<p>As an illustration, Figure~ displays a case were all the proteins
with less than 2 observed (i.e. not imputed) values within each
condition have their p-values pushed to 1. These proteins appear as
points on the horizontal axis of the graph. Notably, the snapshot was
made when the mouse pointer had clicked on one of these proteins which
p-value was pushed (the one with an intensity value between 5.5 and 6).
Its intensity values across the samples appears in the table below,
where one observes that 5 out of 6 values are colored as POV or MEC (see
Section~). Clearly, such a protein as very poor mass spectrometry
evidence, so that even if the imputed values are of different magnitude
(leading to a theoretically appealing p-value), it makes sense to
discard it.</p>

<p>The primary goal of a calibration plot is to check that the p-values
have a distribution that is compliant with FDR computation theory. Given
a supposedly known proportion of non-diffentially abundant proteins
(generally noted

except for a sharp increase on the right hand side, as depicted on
Figure~. The sharp increase, which is the sign of a good discrimination
between proteins which are differentially abundant and those which are
not, is depicted in green. On the contrary, any bulb of the curve above

line (in blue), anywhere in the middle of the graph is depicted in red,
for it is the sign of an insufficient calibration. On Figure~, the
calibration deviation is almost immaterial and the sharpness of the

<p>However, it is possible to face situations where the right hand side
is not sharp enough (see Figure~), or where the entire distribution is
ill-calibrated (see Figure~). In such a cases, FDR computation would
lead to spurious values and to biologically irrelevant conclusions.
However, if the calibration is not too bad, it is possible to compensate
it, by overestimating
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>π</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi_0</annotation></semantics></math>.
This what the first calibration is made for (see Figure~): several
different estimates are depicted by lines of various slope, so as to
help the practitioner to choose the most adapted one to the p-value
distribution at hand. In the worst case, it is always possible to chose
the Benjamini-Hochberg options (corresponding to the safer case of

</h3>
<p>The Gene Ontology (GO, ) is a controlled vocabulary for annotating
three biological aspects of gene products. This ontology is made of
three parts : Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP) and
Cellular Component (CC).</p>
<p><strong>GO analysis</strong> is proposed in the <strong>Data
mining</strong> menu. It aims to provide the user with a global view of
what is impacted (in a biological point of view) in the experiment, by
showing which GO terms are represented (GO classification tab), or
over-represented compared to a reference (GO enrichment tab).</p>
<p><em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.21/Prostar" class="external-link">Prostar</a></em>
relies on the package to perform both GO Classification and GO
Enrichment. We propose a GO analysis interface with four separated tabs
(see Figure~):</p>
<ul>
<li>GO Setup</li>
<li>GO classification</li>
<li>Go Enrichment</li>
<li>Parameter summary</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/GO_tab1.png" alt="GO Setup tab" width="100%"><p class="caption">
GO Setup tab
</p>
</div>
<p>The left-hand side of the <strong>GO Setup</strong> tab allows it to
set the input parameters, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Source of protein ID</strong>: user indicates either a
column in the current dataset or chooses a file (1 ID per line).</li>
<li>
<strong>Id From</strong>: the type of ID supplied (UNIPROT by
default).</li>
<li>
<strong>Genome Wide Annotation</strong>: the organism to consider
for the analysis.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ontology</strong>: the level of the ontology to work
with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these parameters filled, clicking on <strong>Map proteins
IDs</strong> launches the mapping of the IDs onto the GO categories of
the annotation package. Then, on the right-hand side of the panel, the
proportion of proteins that cannot be mapped onto the annotation package
is indicated (this informative output does not interrupt the process,
unless no protein maps). Next step is to perform either GO
Classification or GO Enrichment (or both).</p>
<p>In the <strong>GO Classification</strong> tab (see Figure~), one has
to indicate which level(s) of the ontology to consider. Then clicking on
the “Perform GO grouping” button launches the analysis (function
groupGO() of the package). The graphics shows the most represented GO
categories for a user-defined ontology at (a) user-defined level(s).</p>

<img src="figs/GO_tab2.png" alt="GO classification tab" width="100%"><p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>GO Enrichment</strong> tab (see Figure~) allows it to
know which GO categories are significantly enriched in the users list,
compared to a chosen reference (‘background’ or ‘universe’). This
background can either be :</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the entire organism (in this case, the totality of the proteins
identified with an “ENTREZGENE” ID in the annotation package specified
in the GO Setup tab constitutes the background), or</li>
<li>the entire dataset loaded in Prostar (e.g. all the proteins IDs of
the ‘Leading_razor_protein’ column of the dataset, as illustrated on
Figure~), or</li>
<li>a custom IDs list provided in a separate file by the user (one ID
per line).</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/GO_tab3.png" alt="GO enrichment tab" width="100%"><p class="caption">
GO enrichment tab
</p>
</div>
<p>The enrichment tab calls the groupGO() function of the package. This
function performs a significance test for each category, followed by a
multiple test correction at a user-defined level. Concretely, this level
is tuned thanks to the “FDR (BH Adjusted
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>P</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math>-value
cutoff)” field. Analysis is launched by clicking the <strong>Perform
enrichment analysis</strong> button.</p>
<p>Once the analysis has been performed, the result is displayed via two
graphics on the right-hand side of the panel (see Figure~). The first
one (top) is a barplot showing the five most significant categories. The
length of each bar represents the number of proteins within the
corresponding category. The second one (bottom) is a dotplot ranked by
decreasing <strong>GeneRatio</strong>, which reads:
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="italic">𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>#</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Genes of the input list in this category</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>#</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtext mathvariant="normal">Total number of Genes in the category</mtext><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mi>.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
{\textit{GeneRatio}}
=
\frac{\#(\mbox{Genes of the input list in this category})}
{\#(\mbox{Total number of Genes in the category})}.
</annotation></semantics></math></p>
<p>The last tab is the <strong>Save GO analysis</strong> one. It allows
saving the results: GO classification, GO enrichment, or both (see
Figure~). Then, a new GOAnalysis dataset is created and loaded in
memory.</p>
<p>As usual in Prostar, it is possible to export this new dataset via
the <strong>Data manager</strong> menu, either in MSnSet or in Excel
format.</p>
