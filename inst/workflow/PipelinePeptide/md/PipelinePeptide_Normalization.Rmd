To correct batch or group effects.
The peptide abundances are rescaled (within or
between conditions) to account for the variability between the
analyses. Several algorithms can be used: quantile normalization
(Bolstad, 2007), abundance normalization, scaling/centering (either globally applied or by condition), etc.






Its objective is to reduce the biases introduced at any preliminary stage (such as for instance batch effects).
1. Choose the normalization method (see "Methods available" below for a description of each method).
2. Then, for each normalization method, the interface is automatically updated to display the
method parameters that must be tuned. Notably, for most of the methods, it is necessary to
indicate whether the method should apply to the entire dataset at once, or whether each
condition should be normalized independently of the others. For other parameters, which are
specific to each method, the reader is referred to ProStaR user manual (see the “Manual” section of the Workflow menu).
3. Click on “Do X” or “Do X & proceed”.
4. Observe the influence of the normalization method on the graphs of the right hand side panel.
5. If the result of the normalization does not correspond to the expectations, click on “Reset” to reload the step and change the normalization method or its tuning.
6. Once the normalization is effective, go to the “Save” step and click on “Do X” or “Do X & proceed”.
7. The new version of the dataset, comprised of all previous assays as well as now a "Normalization" assay, is available for download if wanted.
8. Remember that at any time, it is possible to return to the menu “Vizualize data” to have a
refined view of each step of the processing.






### Methods available

**GlobalQuantileAlignment**

This method proposes a normalization of important magnitude that should be cautiously used. It proposes to align the quantiles of all the replicates as described in [Other ref. 1]; practically it amounts to replace abundances by order statistics.

**QuantileCentering**

These methods propose to shift the sample distributions (either all of them at once, or within each condition at a time) to align a specific quantile: the median (under the assumption that up-regulations and down-regulations are equally frequent), the 15% quantile (under the assumption that the signal/noise ratio is roughly the same in all the samples), or any other user's choice.

**MeanCentering**

These methods propose to shift the sample distributions (either all of them at once, or within each condition at a time) to align their means. It is also possible to force unit variance (or not).


**SumByColumns**

These methods propose normalizations of important magnitude that should be cautiously used. It operates on the original scale (not the log2 one) and propose to normalize each abundance by the total abundance of the sample (so as to focus on the analyte proportions among each sample).


**LOESS**

This method proposes to apply a cyclic LOESS [Other ref. 4, 5] normalization to the data (either all of them at once, or on each condition independently). It relates to a combination of multiple regression models. The user can tune the regression span (an higher span smooths the fit more, while a lower span captures more trends).


**vsn**

This method proposes to apply the Variance Stabilization Normalization method [Other ref. 6] to the data (either all of them at once, or on each condition independently). No specific parameters required.
