For datasets that do not contain any missing values, or for those where these missing values have
been imputed, it is possible to test whether each protein is significantly differentially abundant
between the conditions . To do so, click on “Hypothesis testing” in the “Data processing” menu (see
Figure 8).
1. Choose the test contrasts. In case of 2 conditions to compare, there is only one possible contrast.
However, in case of N > 2 conditions, several pairwise contrasts are possible. Notably, it is
possible to perform N tests of the “1vsAll” type, or N(N-1)/2 tests of the “1vs1” type.
2. Then, choose the type of statistical test, between limma [20] or t-test (either Welch or Student).
This makes appear a density plot representing fold-change (FC) (as many density curves on the
plot as contrasts).
3. Thanks to the FC density plot, tune the FC threshold (Note 32).
4. Run the tests and save the dataset to preserve the results (i.e. all the computed p-values). Then,
this new dataset, containing the p-values and FC cut-off for the desired contrasts, can be
explored in the “Differential analysis” tabs available in the “Data mining” menu.



### Step 1

The different result of the tests are stored in the colData.

As for any process, the values of parameters (values of the widgets) are stored
