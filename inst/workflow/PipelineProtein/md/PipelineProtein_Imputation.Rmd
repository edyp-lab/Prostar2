This page describes the computations done with Imputation. 
By taking into account the very nature of each missing value.
To maximize the power of the statistical analysis, the
missing values are imputed. This is achieved with one of the multiple available algorithms that accounts in a specific manner each
for the specific nature of missing values (missing at random, or
lower abundance censorship): k Nearest Neighbors (Hastie et al.,
2001), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Schafer, 2008), Bayesian
Principal Component Analysis (Stacklies et al., 2007), Quantile
Regression to Impute Left-Censored data (Lazar, 2015), etc





In protein-level datasets, ProStaR makes it possible to have separate processing for two different
types of missing values: POV (standing for Partially Observed Value) and MEC (standing for Missing in
the Entire Condition). All the missing values for a given protein in a given condition are considered
POV if and only if there is at least one observed value for this protein in this condition. Alternatively,
if all the intensity values are missing for this protein in this condition, the missing values are
considered MEC (Note 27).
1. On the first tab (see Figure 7), select the algorithm to impute POV missing values. According to
our expertise, we advise to select the SLSA algorithm (Giai Gianetto Q et al., submitted) but other
methods are also of interest in specific situations.
2. Tune the parameters of the chosen imputation method.
3. Click on “Perform Imputation”. It will enables the next tab, on which the result of the imputation
is shown.
4. Move on to the second tab and decide how to deal with MEC. As a matter of fact, it is always
dangerous to impute them, as in absence of any value to rely on, the imputation is arbitrary and
risks to spoil the dataset with maladjusted values. As an alternative, it is possible to (1) keep the
MEC as is in the dataset, yet, it may possibly impede further processing, (2) discard them at the
filter step (see Section 3.5, Step 2) so as to process them separately. However, this will make it
impossible to include these proteins (and their processing) in the final statistics, such as for
instance FDR.
5. If MEC are not going to be imputed, select the imputation method referred to as “None”.
Otherwise, select the appropriate method. Based on our experience, we advise to use
detQuantile (Note 28).
6. Tune the parameters of the MEC imputation method (Note 29).
7. Click on “Perform Imputation” and move on to the next tab (“Validate & save”).
8. Observe the influence of the chosen imputation methods on the graphs of the right hand side
panel. If the result of the imputation does not correspond to the expectations, change the
imputation methods or their tuning (by going back to Step 1 of this section).
9. Once the imputation is effective, click on “Save imputation”.
10. Check that a new version appears in the dataset version dropdown menu, referred to as
“Imputed - Protein” (Notes 30 and 31).
