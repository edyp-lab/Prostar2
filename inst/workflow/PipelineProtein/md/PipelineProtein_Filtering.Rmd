Some proteins may be discarded, on the
basis of several user-defined criteria (number of missing values
within each or across all the biological condition(s), contaminant database, decoy sequences, etc.).



This stage aims at filtering out proteins according to their number of missing values, as well as
according to some information stored in the protein (or feature) metadata.
1. Click on “Filter data” in the “Data processing” menu.
2. On the first tab (called "Missing values", see Figure 5), select among the various options which
proteins should be filtered out or not. The options are the following:
 None: No filtering, the quantitative data is left unchanged (Note 19).
 Whole Matrix: proteins that contain in the quantitative dataset (across all conditions) fewer
non-missing values than a user-defined threshold are deleted;
 For every condition: proteins that contain fewer non-missing values in each condition than a
user-defined threshold are removed;
 At least one condition: proteins that contain fewer non-missing values in at least one
condition than a user-defined threshold are suppressed;
3. Visualize the effect of the filtering options without changing the current dataset by clicking on
"Perform filtering". If the filtering does not produce the expected effect, test another one. To do
so, simply choose another method in the list and click again on "Perform filtering". The plots are
automatically updated. This action does not modify the dataset but offers a preview of the
filtered data. Iterate this step as long as necessary.
4. Move on to the second tab (called "String based filtering"), where it is possible to filter out
proteins according to information stored in the metadata.
5. Among the columns constituting the protein metadata listed in the drop-down menu, select the
one containing the information (Note 20) of interest (for instance, “Contaminant” or “Reverse”,
Note 21). Then, specify in each case the prefix chain of characters that identifies the proteins to
filter (Note 22).
6. Click on "Perform " to remove the corresponding proteins. A new line appears in the table listing
all the filters that have been applied.
7. If another filter must be applied, go back to Step 4.
8. Once all the filters have been applied, move on to the last tab (called "Visualize and Validate") to
check the set of filtered out proteins. This visualization tools works similarly as the Data explorer
(see Section 3.4, Step 4).
9. Finally, click on "Save filtered dataset". The information related to the type of filtering as well as
to the chosen options appears in the Session log tab (“Session logs” tab from the “Session logs”
option in the “Data manager” menu).
